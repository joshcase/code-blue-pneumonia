Code Blue Example Project #1

Pneumonia Antibiotics Decision Aid

An example project from my book, "Code Blue: An Introduction to Programming for Doctors and Medical Students".

A simple antibiotic decision aid designed to assist doctors in making the right choice in patients with pneumonia.

Please note, while these guidelines are loosely based on Australian standards, if youâ€™re treating actual patients, please get your advice from elsewhere. The algorithm has been greatly abridged for the purposes of simplicity and teaching programming. Not intended for clinical use.

If you've got questions or problems, feel free to post them in the Issues tab.

Pull requests welcome.
